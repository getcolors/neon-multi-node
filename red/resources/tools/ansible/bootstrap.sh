# Reconcile this deployment's Neon identity: the R2 prefix ownership markers,
# the tenant, and the timeline. Idempotent by construction — every step reads
# before it writes, treats already-done as success, and verifies its
# postcondition — so a converge that runs this twice changes nothing the
# second time. Prints CHANGED lines for the steps that acted; the playbook's
# changed_when keys on them.
#
# Ownership is two-phase (init marker before any data can exist, ready marker
# only after the smoke gates pass), so three prefix states are distinguishable:
# ready + matching profile is adoptable, init + matching profile is our own
# interrupted bootstrap and safe to resume, anything else with data is foreign
# or unaccounted-for and fails the converge instead of being attached. The
# repair for a genuinely stale prefix is deliberate and manual: delete
# <prefix>/ in R2 yourself, then re-run create.
